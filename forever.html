    <h1>Our Forever, My Purusha ❤️</h1>

    <p>
      Purusha… you know how messy our journey has been.  
      Long distance, fights, misunderstandings… yet here we are.  
      And I wouldn’t change a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I just want us to keep laughing together,  
      checking on each other, annoying each other…  
      and building our little world.
    </p>

    <p>
      No fancy words, no reasons…  
      you are simply my forever. My Purusha. My partner. My best friend.
    </p>

    <h2>So… will you be mine, today and always, Purusha? 💍❤️</h2>

    <p><strong>Forever yours, Shruthi</strong><br>❤️</p>
