    <h1>My Letter To You, My Purusha 💖</h1>

    <p>My Purusha,</p>

    <p>
      We met coincidentally in my hometown, Ooty… and I still believe the universe planned that moment just for us.
      What started as a simple text from you slowly became my favourite part of every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      We spoke daily, shared everything, and in less than two months, on March 1st — my birthday —  
      I confessed my love to you. And you accepted it.  
      That day, without knowing, you became my Purusha… my person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our love was not easy. Long distance tested us in ways I never imagined.
      We faced problems, misunderstandings, and we even got separated twice.
      But love found its way back — through realizations, through understanding, and through choosing each other again.
      Today, our parents know about us… and they accepted us.  
      That itself feels like a blessing from God.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter what happens between us — whether we fight, whether you are busy, or whether the world feels heavy —  
      you always check on me.  
      You never forget to ask how I am.  
      That care… that concern… that love… it means everything to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are like my dad.  
      And since my dad passed away, you became that place of safety for me.
      In you, I see his strength, his protection, and his love.
      That is when I knew… you are not just my boyfriend.
      You are the man I want to walk through life with.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are perfect to me, Purusha.  
      Academically strong, emotionally expressive, kind-hearted, and responsible.
      An all-rounder in every way.
      A flawless human being in my eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no special reason for you to be my forever…  
      You are simply my forever.
      My husband.  
      My boyfriend.  
      My best friend.  
      My partner.  
      My home.
    </p>

    <p>
      But my love… I also need to say this.
      I know I have hurt you many times.
      I know my words and actions have caused you pain.
      And for that, I am truly sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I never meant to hurt you.
      I only loved you too deeply, too emotionally, too fearfully.
      Please forgive me for the times I failed to understand you.
      Please forgive me for the moments I became the reason for your tears.
    </p>

    <p>
      I promise to love you better.
      I promise to choose you with more patience.
      I promise to protect your heart the way you protect mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not just a Valentine’s gift.
      This is my soul written in words.
      This is my promise written in love.
      This is my heart saying —  
      I choose you, my Purusha, today and always.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Forever yours,</strong><br>❤️</p>
