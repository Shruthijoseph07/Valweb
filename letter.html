<h1>My Love Letter To You 💖</h1>

<p class="letter">
My love,<br><br>

From the moment you entered my life, everything changed.  
You didn’t just become a part of my world…  
you became my world.<br><br>

With you, love feels safe.  
With you, happiness feels natural.  
With you, even silence feels beautiful.<br><br>

We have shared laughs, tears, silly fights, deep talks, and unforgettable memories.  
And through all of it, my heart chose you… again and again.<br><br>

I don’t want a perfect life.  
I just want a life with you in it.  
Your hand in mine.  
Your name in my prayers.  
Your heart next to mine — forever.<br><br>

You are not just my Valentine…  
You are my today, my tomorrow, and my always. ❤️
